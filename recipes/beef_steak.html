    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      It is tender, juicy, and flavorful. Beef steak is a flat cut of beef that
      is marinated with olive oil, and it is cooked grilled or broiled. You may
      have tried to make some steak at home, but it seems it never tastes like
      the restaurant.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Beef: 2 steaks cut (about 600 g)</li>
      <li>Olive oil: Â½ cup</li>
      <li>Garlic: 4 cloves</li>
      <li>Rosemary</li>
      <li>Salt: To taste</li>
      <li>Black pepper: To taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Firstly, place the beef in a suitable bowl and pour olive oil. You can
        use different cuts like ribeye, strip, tenderloin, and T-bone for
        preparing steak. Massage the beef with your hands for a few minutes
        until the olive oil covers all the parts of the meat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grate the garlic cloves and add them with rosemary, salt, and black
        pepper to the oil. Mix the ingredients with the oil and massage the beef
        again.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the bowl with a plastic film and let it rest in the refrigerator
        to infuse it with the flavor. An essential point that makes the steak
        tastier is giving it enough time to marinate. To get a good taste and
        make it more tender when cooked, it should rest for at least 12 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Then remove beef slices from the marinade, and shake it to remove any
        excess liquid. Then brush BBQ grills or a heavy-based skillet with oil
        and heat it on high heat. It should get really hot, and you see wisps of
        smoke. The meat will be dried and tough if you grill the steaks with low
        heat for a long time.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the oil is hot, place the steak on it and cook each side for; one
        minute if you like it rare, 2 minutes for medium rare, 3 minutes for
        medium, 4 minutes for medium well, and 5 minutes if you like it well
        cooked. Your beef steak is ready now. Serve it with mashed potatoes and
        caramelized onion, and enjoy.
