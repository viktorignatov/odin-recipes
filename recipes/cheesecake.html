    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      If you're looking for a super creamy baked cheesecake recipe that is easy
      to make (with no water bath required), then this recipe is it! It's rich,
      creamy, slightly tart and has the most irresistible biscuit base. I'd go
      so far as to say it's the BEST cheesecake recipe I've tried!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Cream cheese</li>
      <li>Eggs</li>
      <li>Sour cream</li>
      <li>Strawberries</li>
      <li>Cornstarch</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine the graham cracker crumbs and sugars, then stir in the melted
        butter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Press the mixture into the bottom and up the sides of a springform pan.
        Try to get the crust as high up the sides as possibleâ€“this will help
        prevent cracks. Set this aside while you prepare your filling.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat the cream cheese and sugar until smooth, creamy, and well combined.
        Use a spatula to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl to make sure
        everything is incorporated, then stir in the sour cream and vanilla.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the eggs one at a time, mixing only until just combined after each.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the mixture into your prepared springform pan and bake at 325F for
        45-50 minutes or until the cheesecake is mostly done, but the center is
        still jiggly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk together the sugar and cornstarch in a small saucepan, then add
        the water, lemon juice, and half of the strawberries. Turn the heat to
        medium-low and cook, stirring constantly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the sauce from the heat once the berries have broken down and the
        sauce begins to thicken.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in the butter and remaining berries until combined, then pour into
        a heatproof bowl to cool. You can place this in the fridge to speed up
        the cooling process.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spoon the cooled topping over the chilled cheesecake, slice, and serve.
      </li>
    </ol>
